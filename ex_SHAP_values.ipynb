Doctors (rather than your model) will make the final decision about when to release each patient; but they hope your model will highlight issues the doctors should consider when releasing a patient.\n\nThe hospital has given you relevant patient medical information.

You could look it up in a codebook, but without more medical background it wouldn't mean anything to you anyway.\n- A column names like `glimepiride_No` mean the patient did not have the medicine `glimepiride`. If this feature had a value of False, then the patient did take the drug `glimepiride`\n- Features whose names begin with `medical_specialty` describe the specialty of the doctor seeing the patient.

Could use multiple rows if desired\n\n# Create object that can calculate shap values\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(my_model)\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(data_for_prediction)\nshap.initjs()\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0], data_for_prediction)\n```\n\n## Step 1:\nYou have built a simple model, but the doctors say they don't know how to evaluate a model, and they'd like you to show them some evidence the model is doing something in line with their medical intuition.
